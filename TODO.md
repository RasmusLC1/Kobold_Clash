# Gameplay Loop
    - Choose between 2 modes, descend or endless. Decent takes you through 7 layers of the dungeon to a final boss
    - Collect gold and artifcats in dungeon to buy items, upgrades, healing etc
    - Lower levels have better rewards
    - To get to lower levels you need to pay a soul cost on each floor
    - Each layer has different themes, with unique enemies, mechanics, decoration and traps
    - Each time you complete a floor the next one becomes more difficult
    - There are shrines in the dungeon where you can pay with souls of slain enemies to buy upgrades
    -  Shrines are found in boss rooms and around the dungeon, risk damage to upgrade
    - Different Shrines do different things and are tied to the dungeon theme
    - Game ends when you die, you can find resurrection items in the dungeon, but they are rare or high risk
    - Noice attracts enemies and generates Clatter
    - Clatter system that spawns enemies using a director similar to left4dead
    - Score based on dungeon depth reached, loot and souls collected

# Shop

Upgrade weapons

# Awakening engine
    Generating clatter has a chance to increase the difficulty of the dungeon layer (Awakening)
    Use an aggro budget, similar to Left 4 dead, where each clatter gives the aggro engine resources
    The budget slowly goes up over time even if player does not generate clatter (Prevents boring game)
    Big budget increases for certain events, like discovering the portal or activating certain shrines

    Increasing difficulty can have the following effects
        - Spawn enemies
        - Add traps
        - Give player debuffs
        - Buff enemies
        - Replace doors with walls
        - Replace chests with mimics
        - Reduce light level of all light sources
        - Spawn elite enemies
        - Increase overall clatter level, which increases the consequence of the other effects
        
    Clatter always notifies nearby enemies

    Add skull that gradually fills up with clatter level, hover over for clatter level

    When clatter is generated and has a negative effect apply screen shake and particles on the screen to simulate dungeon shaking and a deep rumble sound

    5 clatter levels, each has different probabilities for events, the higher the clatter level the worse the consequences

    Higher clatter levels generate better loot spawns as well

### Loot mechanic
    - # 3 attributes that affect the loot, depth (1 to 7), clatter (0 to 5) and luck (0 to 10), depth being the most important
    - # 5 tiers of items with the following basic drop rates
        - Common: 400
        - uncommon: 300
        - rare: 200
        - Epic: 80
        - Legendary 20
    - # Formula something like this:
        mult = 1
            + Depth*(tier_norm*1.6 - 0.20)
            + luck*(tier_norm*1.0)
            - Clatter*(tier_norm*0.8 - 0.10)
            
    - # Design loottables for more powerful items to have higher rarities
    - # Basic items that are higher rarity like gems or gold will have a higher amount to represent higher quality
    - # Weapons will have buffs applied to them randomly according to their rarity, common will have none.
        - Generate file with random names based on the rarity of the weapon
    - # Status effects will also have a loot table, where higher quality status effects will be smaller amount at higher rarities and commons will have higher amounts
    - Runes will also be buffed depending on rarity
    - When opening loot container or shrine, 3 options are presented to the player, optional if positive and forced if negative
    - # If a loot container is smashed (like vase) a random item is provided based on the rarity formula
    - # Different kinds of loot containers have different base levels, for example an epic chest will only spawn epic or above loot, meaning the tier distribution becomes Epic 80 and legendary 20
        - # Loot containers get better the deeper in the dungeon you go, each depth layer allows spawning of new types of container, depth 1 only common and uncommon, 2 adds rares, 3 adds epic and 4 adds legendary
    - # Different loot tables based on loot containers, loot containers dictated by dungeon and room type
    - # When spawning loot, check the current player attributes and inventory and increase spawn chance of synergy items for better player experience
